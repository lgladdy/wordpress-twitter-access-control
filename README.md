Wordpress Twitter Access Control
=========

A wordpress plugin that requires visitors to follow you on twitter before they can see anything on the site.

Getting Started
------------------------------------------------
Checkout the code and upload it to a folder inside the wp-content/plugins/ folder.

Create yourself an explaination page that users are directed to to require authenticate.
This should include an explaination of whats about to happen, and why. A "sign in" button is automatically added to that page.

Edit tac-settings.php with a consumer key and secret for the twitter app you want users to authenticate against.
Fill in the required variables, following the comments in that file.
